## Loan_Prediction Problem
# In this problem, I predicted if a financial institution is going approve or reject a loan for its customer based on the historical 
## behavior
## There are 4 different files trainX, trainY, textX and TextY
## The solution is provided in R as .txt file. It worked perfectly in the past. However, I do not take the guarantee, it will work in the future
## I used multiple R packages such as Plyr, SQLDF, GGPLOT, and H2O to develop the prediction
